# Specilization Lab

 Remote controlling of Network Analyzer (NA), Spectrum Analyzer (SA), Lecroy Scope using MATLAB and LABVIEW
 
 Network analyzer is used to measure the cable properties of a telephone cale.
 
 Lecroy scope is used to measure a non-stationary impulse noise (created by using a drill) at two pairs of a star quad of a telephone cable.
 
 Spectrum Analyzer was used to determine a spectrum of a 1MHz rectangular wave that was generated by a function generator.
